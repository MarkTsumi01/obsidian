Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes, and facilitates the organization and structure of software. OOP is based on four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

1. **Encapsulation:**
    
    - **Definition:** Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
    - **Purpose:** It helps hide the internal details of how an object works and exposes only what is necessary, providing a clear interface for interacting with the object.
    - **Example:** An object representing a car might encapsulate attributes like "color" and "speed" along with methods like "accelerate" and "brake."
2. **Inheritance:**
    
    - **Definition:** Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class).
    - **Purpose:** It promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of specialized classes that inherit common characteristics from a more general class.
    - **Example:** If there's a class "Vehicle," a subclass "Car" can inherit characteristics like "move" and "stop" from the base class.
3. **Polymorphism:**
    
    - **Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying types.
    - **Purpose:** It provides flexibility and allows code to work with objects of various types without the need for explicit type checking.
    - **Example:** A method "calculateArea" can work with different shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles) as long as they implement a common interface or base class.
4. **Abstraction:**
    
    - **Definition:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors while ignoring unnecessary details.
    - **Purpose:** It helps manage the complexity of large software systems by focusing on relevant features and hiding implementation details.
    - **Example:** A "Shape" class may abstract common properties like "area" and "perimeter" for various geometric shapes without specifying the details for each shape.

In summary, Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that promotes the organization of code into reusable and modular units called objects. These objects are defined by classes, which encapsulate data and methods, and can participate in relationships like inheritance and polymorphism. OOP encourages a design approach that mirrors real-world entities, making it a powerful and widely used programming paradigm in modern software development.
