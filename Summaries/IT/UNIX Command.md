What is Unix ?

	Unix is a powerful, multiuser, multitasking operating system originally developed in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs. It is widely known for its portability, stability, and security, and it has influenced many other operating systems, including Linux and macOS. Unix provides a range of tools and utilities for efficient file management, process control, and system administration, and it uses a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. Key features include a hierarchical file system, support for multiple users and processes, and a variety of scripting and programming capabilities.
