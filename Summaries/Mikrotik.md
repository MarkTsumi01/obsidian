OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to describe the functions of a networking system

](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/). It serves as a universal set of rules and requirements to ensure interoperability between different products and software in network communications. The model divides network communications into seven abstraction layers:

1. **Physical Layer:** Concerned with transmitting raw data bits across the network using physical resources like cabling, voltages, and radio frequencies.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Involves node-to-node data transfer, error correction, and encompasses sub-layers like Media Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC).
3. **Network Layer:** Responsible for routing frames to their destinations based on logical addresses like IP, utilizing routers to direct information between networks.
4. **Transport Layer:** Manages data packet delivery, error checking, sequencing, and regulates data transfer between systems using protocols like TCP.
5. **Session Layer:** Controls conversations between computers, sets up connections, manages sessions, and includes services like authentication.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Formats data for the application layer based on syntax or semantics accepted by applications, handling encryption and decryption.
7. **Application Layer:** Directly interacts with end-user applications like web browsers or email clients, providing network services and identifying communication partners.
