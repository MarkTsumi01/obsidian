คือระบบเครือข่ายที่เครื่อง host อยู่บนสถานที่ใดสถานที่หนึ่งแต่มีการให้บริการบนอินเทอร์เน็ต

	TCP/IP an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data 

	ip (internet protocol) A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network


TCP/IP model:

- The TCP/IP model is a framework used to conceptualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. It has 4 layers: the application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and network access layer.

- The network access layer deals with creating and transmitting data packets over the network. It uses the ARP protocol to map between IP and MAC addresses.

- The internet layer is responsible for delivering data to the correct destination, potentially on a different network. It uses protocols like IP and ICMP.

- The transport layer manages end-to-end communication between systems/networks. It uses the TCP and UDP protocols.  

- The application layer handles access to network services and applications. It uses protocols like HTTP, SMTP, SSH.

- The TCP/IP model is a simplified version compared to the OSI model, but both models serve the purpose of helping communicate network processes.

- Both the TCP/IP and OSI models are conceptual frameworks used by network professionals to visualize and discuss network operations and potential issues/threats.
